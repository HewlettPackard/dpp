This code is OS-independent. The OS-specific portion of this release 
is <os>/sss.c. Porting DPP to a different OS requires definition of a
new sss.c module for the new OS. Each <os>/sss.c must:

  1. provision an 802.11 interface-- band, channel, etc.-- such that
     802.11 action frames can be sent out of it.
  2. provide an API to send 802.11 action frames out the radio.
  3. subscribe to DPP action frames received from the kernel.
  4. call DPP APIs to run PKEX and DPP Authentication.
  5. provide APIs to DPP to provision an 802.11 interface per the
     data received during DPP provisioning.
  6. implement provisioned role
     6a) AP needs to beacon out the provisioned SSID with the
         DPP AKM.
     6b) STA needs to scan for the provisioned SSID, initiate
         DPP discovery when found.
  7. take the PMK that results from DPP discovery and use it--
     associate, do the 4way handshake with the PMK, plumb the
     resulting secrets to the radio and start networking!

A generic service model, service.[ch], is included to allow <os>/sss.c
to manage socket interfaces and allow dpp and pkex to manage timers.
Replacement of service.[ch] with a different service model should be
trivial. 

os_glue.h defines the external API each <os>/sss.c must have
to allow DPP to use to send frames over the air. These are:

  - transmit_<pkex/auth/config>_frame()

	To transmit the appropriate frame, passed as data with a 
	specified length, as an 802.11 action frame.

  - void change_dpp_channel()

    	Support for option of changing DPP channel after receiving
	Auth request.

  - void boostrap_peer()
    	Parse the bootstrapping key file and begin DPP. Needed as
	an os_glue API just for PKEX.

  - provision_connector()
	Parse credential and output netaccesskey and connector for
	use by the DPP peer.
	
  - void fin()

	To obtain notification of termination of DPP. 

To port this code to another OS it is necessary to provide these APIs
and perform the necessary function. dpp.h and pkex.h define the routines
each <os>/sss.c must call to perform PKEX and DPP Authentication.

It will also be necessary to provision a radio appopriately and
initialize PKEX and DPP through:

int pkex_initialize (int whatkind, char *password, char *id, char *info, 
		     char *keyfile, char *bsfile, int verbosity);

and

int dpp_initialize (int initiator, int core, int mutual, char *keyfile, 
		    char *bsfile, char *signkeyfile, char *enrolleerole, 
		    int opclass, int channel, int verbosity)

Before beginning the protocol.

DPP discovery does not use a DPP instance created with dpp_initialize().
One must call

unsigned char get_dpp_discovery(void)

to obtain a transaction ID, bind appropriate MAC addresses to that state,
and pass the transaction ID to the appropriate discovery API.
