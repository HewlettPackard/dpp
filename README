Device Provisioning Protocol
-----------------------------

  DPP provides a way to authenticate and provision a device taking
part in the "enrollee" role by a device taking part in the "configurator"
role.

  Trust in the authentication is bootstrapped using either scanned QR
codes or PKEX. Regardless of bootstrapping method, a flat file contains
the regulatory information, in the form of operating class and channel,
the MAC address of the device, and the device's public key is saved in
a flat file for use by DPP Authentication. 

  The OS-specific components reside in directories named for their
respective OS, for example the freebsd OS-specific component is 
in freebsd/sss.c. The OS-independent component is dpp.c and pkex.c. The 
other .c files are helper modules. See PORTING for a description
of the interfaces the modules have to each other.

  Multiple DPP applications can communicate over a loopback interface to
simulate a network. Each OS-specific component supports communication
over the loopback interface.

RESTRICTIONS

  macos only supports DPP over wired (controller.c and device.c).

  Freebsd sss currently only supports Atheros radios.

REQUIREMENTS

  libcrypto from OpenSSL, version 0.9.8 or later. Basically, all
you need is EC support that has the pre-defined groups.

BUILDING

  The file freebsd_6.4_RC1_diffs contains patches for a few
kernel files in freebsd 6.4_RC1 (other versions should be
straightforward to patch as the diffs are minor) to allow for the
sending of 802.11 authentication frames via a BPF. Rebuild the
OS with these patchs.

  Change directories to the top level and run the autotools commands:

% aclocal
% autoconf
% automake

   Then configure the package like this:

% ./configure --with-ssl="<directory>" [--enable-brainpool] 

where <directory> is the top level directory of openssl. Enable
Brainpool if you have support for those curves. Then change
directories into the one that matches your OS-- macos, linux,
or freebsd-- and make.

HOW TO USE

  sss can be run to do PKEX only, DPP only, or PKEX followed by DPP.
If a scanning Configurator is hooked up it must export the scanned
public key in the form required by the bootstrapping keys flat file:

  <index> <operating class> <channel> <macaddress> <b64 encoded key>

  sss uses command line options to pick the interface, the role, the
keys to use, the files in which to place trusted keys, and the various
parameters to set when running PKEX and/or DPP:

USAGE: ./sss [-hCIBapkceirdfgs]
        -h  show usage, and exit
        -c <signkey> run DPP as the configurator, sign connectors with <signkey>
        -e <role> run DPP as the enrollee in the role of <role> (sta or ap)
        -i  run DPP as the initiator
        -r  run DPP as the responder
        -a  do not perform mutual authentication in DPP
        -C <filename> of radio configuration file
        -I <interface> to add to DPP
        -B <filename> of peer bootstrappign keys
        -p <password> to use for PKEX
        -f <channel> to use with DPP
        -g <opclass> operating class to use with DPP
        -z <info> to pass along with public key in PKEX
        -n <identifier> for the code used in PKEX
        -k <filename> my bootstrapping key
        -b  bootstrapping (PKEX) only, don't run DPP
        -x  <index> DPP only with key <index> in -B <filename>, don't do PKEX
        -m <MAC address> to initiate to, otherwise uses broadcast
        -s  change opclass/channel to what was set with -f and -g
        -d <debug> set debugging mask


* PKEX Only

  Start up a PKEX responder:

% ./sss -I lo0 -r -p fubar -n blah -k respp256.pem -B respbkeys.txt -b -d 63

This says to use interface lo0 (loopback), run as the responder, use "fubar"
as the password and "blah" as the identifier, use respp256.pem as the
bootstrapping key, use respbkeys.txt as the flat file of peer's trusted
bootstrapping keys, do PKEX only, and set the debugging mask to be verbose.
The responder will wait until an intiator beings PKEX to it.

  Start up a PKEX initiator:

% ./sss -I lo0 -i -p fubar -n blah -k initp256.pem -B initbkeys.txt -b -d 63

This says to use interface lo0 (loopback), run as the initiator, use "fubar"
as the password and "blah" as the identifier, use initp256.pem as the
bootstrapping key, use initbkeys.txt as the flat file of peer's trusted
bootstrapping keys, do PKEX only, and set the debugging mask to be verbose.

* PKEX then DPP

  Start up a responder/enrollee:

% ./sss -I ath0 -r -e ap -p thisissecret -k respbp384.pem -B respbkeys.txt -d 63

This says to use the interface ath0 (802.11 radio), run as the responder, run as
the enrollee with a role of "ap", use "thisissecret" as the PKEX password, use
respbp384.pem as the bootstrapping key, use respbkeys.txt as the flat file of
peer's trusted bootstrapping keys, and set verbose debugging.

% ./sss -I lo0 -i -c signp521.pem -p thisissecret -k initbp384.pem -B initbkeys.txt -d 63

This says to use the interface ath0 (802.11 radio)), run as the initiator, run as a
configurator and sign with the key signp521.pem, use "thisissecret" as the PKEX
password, use initbp384.pem as the bootstrapping key, use initbkeys.txt as the flat
file of peer's trusted bootstrapping keys, and set verbose debugging.

  Since this was a run of DPP as well, the enrollee will get a connector signed by
the configurator. Since the enrollee had the role "ap" it will get a connector for
the role of AP and be given an SSID to advertise. The ath0 interface on this device
is now provisioned for DPP on that SSID and awaits connection from a STA. The
connector received from this run is for the SSID "goaway" and looks like this:

connector is signed with ES512, by key with key id:
 SRHSlHn-YkFGdNq1XIBesoIy4YaSZGs7IRhvo8_py8s
configurator's signing key is valid!!!

with SSID goaway

This is printed because debugging is set to verbose.

  A STA can be provisioned on another device by running something similar, for example:

% ./sss -I ath0 -r -e sta -p somethingunique -k stabp384.pem -B stabkeys.txt

which, when it completes, will obtain a connector useful for a STA and told to 
connect to "goaway". When it does it will exchange connectors and derive a PMK.

* Wired DPP

  A TCP/IP version of DPP is included with relay.c, controller.c, and device.c
The controller is an aggregator of DPP conversations done over the wire through
relays which encaps/decaps 802.11 action frames into/out of TCP/IP. The device
speaks DPP solely through TCP/IP, no action frames used. 

  To run it you need either a controller and a device or a controller, a relay,
and a regualar instance of sss. For example,

On freebsd, sss is running as a responder not doing mutual authentication
(i.e. like a typical IoT device)

 % sudo ./sss -I ath0 -r -e sta -k respp256.pem -a -d 63

On linux a relay is running that would connect to a controller 10.10.10.99
if anyone initiated to it and it will snoop for DPP frames with a responder's
bootstrapping key indicated by the contents of controller.pem:

 % sudo ./relay -I wlp58s0 -C 10.10.10.99 -k controller.pem -d 63

And on macos the controller can be run to attach to a relay at 10.10.10.98
and assuming the IoT device's (freebsd sss) public key has been bootstrapped
into index 1 of initbkeys.txt:

 % sudo ./controller -i -c signp256.pem -I 10.10.10.98 -k controller.pem \
-B initbkeys.txt -x 1 -d 63

The controller will initiate through the relay to the IoT device and provision
a connector on it.

CONTENTS OF DISTRIBUTION

  There are various keys to use by the initiator (initXXX.pem) and the responder
(respXXX.pem) and to use for signatures by the configurator (signXXX.pem). The
curves are identified as:

  p256 -- NIST 256-bit elliptic curve
  p384 -- NIST 384-bit elliptic curve
  p521 -- NIST 521-bit elliptic curve
  bp256 -- Brainpool 256-bit elliptic curve
  bp384 -- Brainpool 384-bit elliptic curve
  bp512 -- Brainpool 512-bit elliptic curve

More, or different ones, can be made with openssl.

  There is a QR code for the controller-- controller.png contains the
public key found in controller.pem.
